# -Impact_Of_Car_Features_On_Price_And_Profitability

# Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City.

# Software Tools
 - Excel
 - power bi (Dashbord)

# Here is a brief overview of the dataset:

Number of observations: 11,159
Number of variables: 16
File type: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

# The variables in the dataset are:

- Make: the make or brand of the car
- Model: the specific model of the car
- Year: the year the car was released
- Engine Fuel Type: the type of fuel used by the car (gasoline, diesel, etc.)
- Engine HP: the horsepower of the car's engine
- Engine Cylinders: the number of cylinders in the car's engine
- Transmission Type: the type of transmission (automatic or manual)
- Driven_Wheels: the type of wheels driven by the car (front, rear, all)
- Number of Doors: the number of doors the car has
- Market Category: the market category the car belongs to (Luxury, Performance, etc.)
- Vehicle Size: the size of the car 
- Vehicle Style: the style of the car (Sedan, Coupe, etc.)
- Highway MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets on the highway
- City MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets in the city
- Popularity: a ranking of the popularity of the car (based on the number of times it has been viewed on Edmunds.com)
- MSRP: the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the car

# This dataset could be useful for a variety of data analysis tasks, such as:

- Exploring trends in car features and pricing over time
- Comparing the fuel efficiency of different types of cars
- Investigating the relationship between a car's features and its popularity
- Predicting the price of a car based on its features and market category

However, it's important to note that the dataset was last updated in 2017, so it may not reflect current trends or prices in the automotive industry.

# Business and Data Analytics Skills:

The given tasks below based on the business problem would require advanced Excel skills and knowledge of data analysis techniques such as regression analysis, pivot tables, sensitivity analysis, optimization, and time series analysis. 

However, by answering these questions and building an interactive dashboard, a data analyst could provide valuable insights to a car manufacturer and help them optimize their pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand.

- __Tasks: Analysis__ 
 Before diving into the analysis of the given dataset, it is important to perform thorough data cleaning to ensure accurate and reliable results. You need to build an interactive dashboard in Excel from the tasks given below:

- Insight Required: How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?
Task 1.A: Create a pivot table that shows the number of car models in each market category and their corresponding popularity scores.
Task 1.B: Create a combo chart that visualizes the relationship between market category and popularity.

- Insight Required: What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?
Task 2:  Create a scatter chart that plots engine power on the x-axis and price on the y-axis. Add a trendline to the chart to visualize the relationship between these variables.

- Insight Required: Which car features are most important in determining a car's price? 
Task 3: Use regression analysis to identify the variables that have the strongest relationship with a car's price. Then create a bar chart that shows the coefficient values for each variable to visualize their relative importance.

- Insight Required: How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?
Task 4.A: Create a pivot table that shows the average price of cars for each manufacturer. 
Task 4.B: Create a bar chart or a horizontal stacked bar chart that visualizes the relationship between manufacturer and average price.

- Insight Required: What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?
Task 5.A: Create a scatter plot with the number of cylinders on the x-axis and highway MPG on the y-axis. Then create a trendline on the scatter plot to visually estimate the slope of the relationship and assess its significance.
Task 5.B: Calculate the correlation coefficient between the number of cylinders and highway MPG to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship.
## Building the Dashboard:

Now for the Next portion of the Project, you need to create the Interactive Dashboard. 
Use filters and slicers to make the chart interactive. The client has requested these questions given below:

Task 1: How does the distribution of car prices vary by brand and body style?
